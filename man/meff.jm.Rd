\title{Estimate the Effective Number of Tests}
\usage{
meff.jm(mydat, B = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydat}{A design matrix with \eqn{n} observations (rows) and \eqn{p} covariates (columns).}

\item{B}{Integer. Number of permutations to perform. (Default is 1)}
}
\value{
Numeric. Returns the estimated effective number of tests averaged over \code{B} permutations.
}
\description{
Estimate the effective number of tests using a permutation-based approach.
}
\details{
The effective no of independent vars is the sum of the scaled eigenvalues for truly independent vars (n) 
minus the variance inflation of the top eigenvalues, that is, (observed - permuted)
The sum of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix = trace = sum of diag = n.
The eigenvalues of variables X can be thought of as normalized % variance explained by X.
Dependencies between variables will increase the magnitude of top eigenvalues,
therefore, the effective number of independent variables is equal to the proportion of the
sum of eigenvalues attributed to independence minus the proportion attributed to dependencies.

\examples{

# Independent
ss=300
nvar=100
X = as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(ss * nvar), nrow = ss, ncol = nvar))
meff.jm(X, B = 5)

# High correlation
S = matrix(0.9, ss, nvar)
diag(S) = 1
X = as.matrix(X) \%*\% chol(S)
meff.jm(X, B = 5)
